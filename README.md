# 🛒 Electronic Store (Demo Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
**Electronic Store** is a front-end demo project that simulates an online electronics shopping experience. Built for educational purposes, the website showcases how an e-commerce interface works — including browsing products, viewing details, and interacting with a shopping cart — without involving real transactions or backend integration.

## 💡 Purpose
This project was developed as part of a web development learning journey. It provides hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and demonstrates how a basic e-commerce site is structured and styled.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – Page structure  
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** – Interactivity and dynamic behavior  

## ✨ Features
- ✅ Clean, user-friendly interface  
- ✅ Product categories (e.g., phones, laptops, appliances)  
- ✅ Product detail pages with images and specifications  
- ✅ Simulated shopping cart (add/remove products)  
- ✅ Contact form (non-functional, for demo only)  

## 🗂️ Website Pages
- **Home Page** – Highlights featured products and links to categories  
- **Categories Page** – Displays products grouped by category  
- **Product Page** – Shows product specifications and images  
- **Cart Page** – Simulates cart functionality (quantity updates, removals)  
- **Contact Page** – A simple form for mock user messages  

## 🚀 How to Explore the Site
1. Open the demo: [Electronic Store](https://yara-matter.github.io/Ecommerce-Electronic-Store/)
2. Navigate through categories and select products  
3. Add items to the cart and view your selections  
4. Explore the contact page for a basic form layout  

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This is a static front-end project for **demonstration only**. No real purchases can be made, and no personal data is collected. All functionalities are simulated on the client side without a database or server.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
